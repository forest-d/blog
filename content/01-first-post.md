Summary: Testing my first blog post with Pelican

# Hello, world

I've decided to use [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) + GitHub pages to build out this blog. It's a fairly straightforward and almost entirely free way of 
hosting a blog (thanks GitHub). Even the image hosting is free! My only expense here is the domain name through Namecheap.

The posts are written as Markdown files, which is comfy for me. I have a `Justfile` set up so I can type `just github` and the blog gets deployed.

I'm using the [cid theme](https://github.com/hdra/Pelican-Cid) as a base, it's clean enough and customizing it to my liking has been simple. 

Image embeds w/custom styling:

The blog itself is entirely contained in [this repo](https://github.com/forest-d/blog).

Here's to many more blog posts.
